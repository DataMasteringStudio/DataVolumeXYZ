<!-- intro -->
This is the fourth in a series of posts documenting the challenges, progress, setbacks, and victories of The Data Dojo: A Power BI Community of Practice. 
- In [Part 1](../../../2023/04/02/DataDojo-PowerBI-CommunityOfPractice-01.html), I shared the story of how I founded the Data Dojo at [Des Moines University (DMU)](https://dmu.edu). 
- In [Part 2](../../../2023/05/28/DataDojo-PowerBI-CommunityOfPractice-02.html), I shared summaries of our first two workshops, and a cautionary tale about our first major setback. 
- In [Part 3](../../../2023/10/07/DataDojo-PowerBI-CommunityOfPractice-03.html), I shared a summary of our third workshop, talked about our comeback story, and outlined our plans to ensure that the Data Dojo will continue to grow and thrive for many years to come. 
- In this post, I'll tell you about our fourth workshop, which was our most important and impactful workshop yet, and I'll explain why I believe that every Power BI Community of Practice should host a workshop like this at least once per year.

# The Data Dojo Strikes Back (Our Fourth Workshop)

We hosted our fourth workshop on _, and it was attended by _ members. This was a significant improvement in turnout over our third workshop, and a very encouraging sign that the Data Dojo is finally back on track, healthy, and growing again. We were thrilled to welcome several new members to the Data Dojo for the first time at this workshop, and we're excited to not only help them discover their own unique paths to data literacy and mastery, but also to learn from them as they bring their own unique knowledge, perspectives, and experiences to the table.

Our fourth workshop was a very exciting milestone for us because, unlike any of our previous workshops (which mostly consisted of PowerPoint presentations and Q&A sessions), this was an **actual workshop** -- no slide deck, just a live, interactive, hands-on tour of Power BI Desktop!
