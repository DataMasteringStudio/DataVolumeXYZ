# Next Time: The Data Dojo Goes Global!

As I'm sure many of you already know, I've been speaking about the Data Dojo at various conferences, user groups, and livestreams for a couple of years now. In my conversations with some of the folks I've met at these events, I've learned that many of them are interested in founding similar Power BI Communities of Practice within their own organizations all over the world.

So, in the next installment of this series, I'll be sharing some of the insights I've gained from these conversations, and I'll be talking about how we're planning to help other organizations establish their own Data Dojos, and our vision for a global network of Power BI Communities of Practice. This process is still in its very early stages, so I don't know exactly what it's going to look like yet, or how long it will be before I have more to share, but I'm thrilled to be embarking on this new quest in the Data Dojo saga, and I can't wait to see where it takes us.

If you are interested in founding a Power BI Community of Practice within your organization, or if you're just curious to learn more about what we're doing with the Data Dojo, I'd love to hear from you!
