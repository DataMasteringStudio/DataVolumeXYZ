description: A series about founding and fostering a successful Power BI Community of Practice
---

<!-- intro -->
This is the third in a series of posts documenting the challenges, progress, setbacks, and victories of The Data Dojo: A Power BI Community of Practice.
In [Part 1](../../../2023/04/02/DataDojo-PowerBI-CommunityOfPractice-01.html), I shared the story of how I founded the Data Dojo at [Des Moines University (DMU)](https://dmu.edu). In [Part 2](../../../2023/05/28/DataDojo-PowerBI-CommunityOfPractice-02.html), I talked about our first two workshops, and shared a cautionary tale about our first major setback.
In this post, I'll tell you all about:
  - Our third workshop, including a summary of the critical, foundational topic we covered, and why it was so important for us to establish that foundation before moving on to more advanced topics.
  - How we clawed our way back from the brink of disaster following our setback, and began rebuilding the trust and confidence of our members.
  - Our plans for ensuring that the Data Dojo will continue to grow and thrive for many years to come.

Thank you for joining us on this adventure!

# Waking the Sleeping Dragon (Our Third Workshop)

We hosted our third workshop on August 2nd, 2023, and as I mentioned in [Part 2](../../../2023/05/28/DataDojo-PowerBI-CommunityOfPractice-02.html), it had been a *very* long time since our last workshop, so the stakes were quite high. We had to prove to everyone (ourselves included) that we could:
- Rebound quickly from a major setback
- Resume attracting new members, delivering value to our existing members, and providing a safe and welcoming environment for everyone
- Recommit ourselves to building a strong community and fostering a culture of knowledge sharing and collaboration within our organization

Our third workshop was attended by just *twelve* members -- a much lower turnout than either of our previous workshops. I had actually anticipated a significant dip in attendance at our third workshop (as a result of the issues I outlined in the ["Our First Major Setback" section of Part 2](../../../2023/05/28/DataDojo-PowerBI-CommunityOfPractice-02.html#Our-First-Major-Setback)), but even though I saw it coming, it still hit me pretty hard and left me feeling more than a little disappointed (mostly in myself). However, this storm cloud had two clearly visible silver linings:
1. Most of the attrition in attendance consisted of members who participated only minimally during the first two workshops, while nearly all of the members who attended the third workshop were eager participants in the first two workshops, and continued that trend during the third. Obviously, we'll need to figure out how to re-engage our less active members, but we can at least take comfort in the fact that we have a solid core of members whose unwavering enthusiasm will keep us energized and help us navigate even the most turbulent waters.
2. We also had several new members join us for the first time, and we were thrilled to welcome them to the Data Dojo. We're always excited when new members arrive, but it was especially encouraging to see new members put their faith in us during a time when we were still reeling from a major setback, and the future of the Data Dojo was perhaps uncertain, or even precarious (particularly from their outside perspective).
The fact that these new members chose to join our ranks _**despite our readily apparent struggles and shortcomings**_ is a testament to the strength and resilience of our community, and the real value that our members provide, both to each other and to the organization at large.

For our third workshop, we focused on providing simple definitions, real world examples, and clear explanations for most of the common technical "jargon" terms that Data Dojo members are likely to encounter while working with data ([slide deck pdf](../../../assets/doc/DMU_Data_Dojo_-_Meeting_003.pdf){:target="_blank"}). Compared to the topics we covered in our previous workshops, this one was probably a little boring. However, it is absolutely critical for everyone working with data in an organization to have a unified vocabulary and a shared understanding of how each term relates to the organization's overall data analytics strategy and specific implementation. This is especially true for a Community of Practice like the Data Dojo, where members are encouraged to share their knowledge and collaborate with each other. If we don't all speak the same language, then we can't communicate effectively with each other, and all of our collaborative and knowledge-sharing efforts will be severely hampered. So, even though this subject may have been a little dry, it was still very important for us to get everyone speaking the same technological dialect, and I'm glad we did it.

## The Art of War: Strategy First, Then Tactics
- Beware of "tunnel vision" masquerading as "laser focus"
- Zoom out, re-calibrate, and then zoom back in
- Target attainable goals first, then set stretch goals
- Don't be afraid to pivot when necessary

> "Strategy without tactics is the slowest route to victory.  
> Tactics without strategy is the noise before defeat."
