description: A series about founding and fostering a successful Power BI Community of Practice

<!-- intro -->
This is the second in a series of posts documenting the challenges, progress, setbacks, and victories of The Data Dojo: A Power BI Community of Practice. In [Part 1 of this series](../../../2023/04/02/DataDojo-PowerBI-CommunityOfPractice-01.html), I shared the story of how I founded the Data Dojo at Des Moines University (DMU), and in this post, I'll share brief summaries of our first two workshops, and a cautionary tale about our first major setback.

# Our First Workshop

We launched the Data Dojo with our first workshop on July 20th, 2022, and it was a huge success!  
We had *eighteen* members in attendance, and we covered the following topics (slide deck [here](../../../assets/doc/placeholder.pdf)):
- Introductions around the room
- What we're doing here, and why it matters
- The importance of speed and accuracy in data analysis, and what we mean by "speed" and "accuracy"
- Data driven decision makers:
  - What they **do know**
  - What they often **don't know**
- The current paradigm and state of data analysis at DMU
- The new paradigm — our vision for the future
- Our plans for turning that vision into a reality
- Testimonials from four Data Dojo members who had already been using Power BI in their day-to-day jobs, experienced first-hand the benefits of data-driven decision making, and successfully collaborated on at least one Power BI project with one or more colleagues from other departments
- Our next steps
  - Added everyone who attended the workshop to our private Yammer group, and encouraged them to introduce themselves, ask questions, share ideas, and vote on dates and topics for future workshops
  - Provided [a list of Power BI learning resources](../../../assets/doc/placeholder.pdf) for those who wanted to dive in right away <!-- need to add this document -->

# Our Second Workshop

We held our second Data Dojo workshop about a month later, this time with *twenty* members in attendance!  
Here's an outline of what we covered (slide deck [here](../../../assets/doc/placeholder.pdf)):
- [**The Five Types of Data Analytics**](https://www.biconnector.com/blog/5-types-of-data-analytics-explained-with-examples/)
  1. Descriptive — *"What happened, where, and when?"*
  2. Diagnostic — *"Why did it happen?"*
  3. Predictive — *"What will happen in the future?"*
  4. Prescriptive — *"What should we do about it?"*
  5. Cognitive — *"How can we do it better?"*
 - **The Data Analytics Cycle** <!--Need to find a better source for this -->
  1. Requirements gathering
  2. Data ingestion and processing
  3. Data exploration
  4. Data analysis
  5. Deploy analytics solution
  6. Request and process feedback
  7. Optimize solution
  8. Repeat
- [**Structured vs. Unstructured Data**](https://www.datamation.com/big-data/structured-vs-unstructured-data/)
  - Definitions
  - Examples
- **Better Instruction Through Data** — A presentation by one of our members from outside the IT department, which included:
  - A live demo of some of the reports he had made using curated datasets provided by the IT department
  - Stories of how several of his reports had already made a significant impact on the way his department operates on a day-to-day basis
  - Examples of some challenges he has encountered working with data, and how he overcame them by utilizing our learning resources and collaborating with other members of the Data Dojo from both his own department and other departments

# Our First Major Setback

After such a strong start, it really felt like nothing could stop us, and we were well on our way to achieving our vision of a data-driven DMU. But then, we hit a snag. **A *big* one.**

For several years, DMU has been in the process of [building a new campus](https://www.dmu.edu/new-campus/) in West Des Moines, and it's scheduled to open later this year (Fall of 2023). Of course, this is a huge undertaking, and it's been a major focus for the entire university. As you can probably imagine, every department at DMU has been extremely busy with a number of projects related to the new campus, and that has had a significant impact on the amount of time and energy they have been able to devote to the Data Dojo. 

I'd really like to say that the new campus project commitments were the only thing that slowed us down, but that wouldn't be entirely true. I also made a few mistakes along the way, and I'd like to share them with you so that you can avoid making the same mistakes.

## Mistake #1: Failing to Keep a Consistent Schedule

After our second workshop, we had a lot of momentum, and I was eager to keep it going, but I didn't have a clear plan for how to do that. I knew that I wanted to hold a workshop every month or so, but given the frenetic pace of projects at the new campus, it was hard to find dates that worked for most of our members. I really should have just found a date that worked for a dozen or so members, but instead I kept pushing it back indefinitely, hoping that I would eventually find a date that worked for everyone. The worst part of this was that I didn't communicate any of this to our members, so they had no idea what was going on. I'm sure that many of them thought the Data Dojo had just fizzled out, and that was entirely my fault.

## Mistake #2: Failing to Keep the Conversation Going

My second mistake was not having a strategy for keeping the conversation going between workshops. I had created a private Yammer group for the Data Dojo, and everyone who had attended at least one workshop so far was a member of that group, but my efforts at encouraging members to engage in conversations there achieved only sporadic results at best. There were definitely some great conversations, but mostly between the same few members, and I also didn't do a very good job of seeding the discussion myself with new material. I should have been posting more questions, sharing more ideas, and encouraging more members to do the same. 

## Mistake #3: Letting "Perfect" Be the Enemy of "Good"

In the wake of two well-attended workshops and quite a bit of buzz circulating around the organization, I started thinking to myself, "This next workshop will need to be absolutely mind-blowing," and I started daydreaming about how I could make our third Data Dojo workshop the best one yet. My third (and biggest) mistake was allowing those daydreams and high expectations to cloud my judgment, and eventually undermine much of what I had been working so hard to achieve.

At the time, I had been collaborating for several months with the creators of an open-source project called [Power BI Version Control](https://powerbi.tips/2021/02/power-bi-version-control/) (a user-friendly solution based on Power Apps and SharePoint that helps business users keep their .pbix files in a basic version control system). The app's creators and I were getting very close to releasing a highly-anticipated bugfix version, and I really wanted our third Data Dojo workshop to center around deploying the latest version of Power BI Version Control for all Data Dojo members to use with their teams.

But, as you've probably guessed by now, the release date for the bugfix version kept getting pushed back, and I kept pushing back the date for our next workshop along with it. I was so focused on getting the timing just right that I didn't even consider the possibility that I could just run our third Data Dojo workshop as usual, without even mentioning the Power BI Version Control app, and just wait to blow everyone's minds until the fourth or fifth workshop. I was so focused on achieving a **perfect** workshop that I didn't even consider the possibility of a **good** one. 

## Summary of Mistakes:

The cumulative result of these indefinite delays and communication failures was that the Data Dojo didn't have a single workshop for nearly three quarters of a year, and most of our initial momentum and enthusiasm were lost. I was talking about this situation with my wife the other day, trying to determine exactly where I had gone wrong, and I think she really nailed it with her analysis: 
>"It's a bit idealistic to assume that anything in tech happens on a convenient or timely schedule. Prioritizing conversation, regardless of content and attendence perfection, is clearly an important factor in developing the kind of data-driven and data-literate culture that any organization would benefit from."

# Conclusion

Well, that was a lot of bad news! But don't worry, there's light at the end of this tunnel. While we have reached the conclusion of this article, we have **not** seen the last of the Data Dojo. In the next post, I'll share our comeback story, and how we're working to ensure that the Data Dojo will continue to grow and thrive for years to come. Stay tuned!
