# Introduction

After nearly two and a half years of running the Data Dojo, we've learned a lot about what works and what doesn't when it comes to fostering a successful Power BI Community of Practice. One of the most important lessons we've learned is that it's essential to keep things fresh and exciting for our members. That's why we're always looking for new ways to engage our community and provide them with valuable learning experiences. Those of you who've been keeping up with this series will know that we've experimented with a variety of workshop formats, from traditional presentations and demos to hands-on labs and interactive discussions. In this post, I'll tell you about a brand new style of Data Dojo workshop which we call "Office Hours & Coffee Lounge," why we decided to add this new format to our repertoire, and how it's been going so far.

# What Is "Office Hours & Coffee Lounge"?

"Office Hours & Coffee Lounge" is a new workshop format that we recently introduced to the Data Dojo in response to feedback from our members. The idea behind this format is to create a relaxed and informal space where members can drop in, ask questions, share ideas, and connect with other members of the community. The format is inspired by the concept of "office hours" in academia, where professors make themselves available to students outside of class to answer questions and provide guidance. We decided to combine this concept with the idea of a "coffee lounge;" a casual meeting place where people can gather to socialize and relax. The result is a workshop format that is designed to be low-pressure, interactive, and community-driven.

Just like our other workshop formats, "Office Hours & Coffee Lounge" workshops are open to all members of the Data Dojo, regardless of their level of experience with Power BI, but unlike our other workshops, they are not structured around a specific topic or agenda. Instead, the focus is on creating an open and welcoming space where members can come together to learn from each other, share their knowledge, and build relationships with their peers. As such, when we schedule an "Office Hours & Coffee Lounge" workshop, we don't prepare any presentation or demo materials in advance. Instead, we simply invite our members to join us for an informal chat, and we let the conversation flow naturally from the participants' questions, comments, and ideas.


# Why Add A New Workshop Format?

We decided to introduce the "Office Hours & Coffee Lounge" format to the Data Dojo for several reasons. First and foremost, we wanted to provide our members with a new and different kind of learning experience. We found that while our more structured workshops were valuable for teaching specific skills and concepts, they could sometimes feel a bit rigid and formal, which might not be the best fit for everyone. We thought that by offering a more casual, unstructured format, we could create a space where members would feel more comfortable and engaged, and where they would have more freedom to explore, discuss, and experiment with Power BI in a way that suited their own learning style.

Second, we wanted to give our members an opportunity to connect with each other in a more relaxed setting. One of the things that makes the Data Dojo special is the collaborative spirit and camaraderie that we've built among our members, and we wanted to find new ways to further enhance their sense of shared passion and purpose. We thought that by creating a space where members could come together to chat, ask questions, and share their ideas, we could help to strengthen the bonds between them and create a more vibrant and engaged community.

Finally, we wanted to experiment with a new format that would allow us to be more responsive to the needs and interests of our members. By removing the structure and agenda from our workshops, we hoped to create a space where members could drive the conversation and shape the direction of the workshop based on their own interests and questions. We thought that this could help us to better understand the needs and priorities of our members, and to tailor our future workshops to better meet those needs.

# OK, But Does It Actually Work?

When we first introduced the "Office Hours & Coffee Lounge" format, we weren't sure how it would be received, but we were pleasantly surprised by the overwhelmingly positive responses from the members who chose to attend. Many of them told us that they appreciated the opportunity to connect with other members of the community in a more relaxed setting, and that they found the format to be a refreshing change of pace from our more structured workshops. Some of them even said that they felt more comfortable asking questions and sharing their ideas in this format than they did in our other workshops, which was exactly the kind of feedback we were hoping to hear. Based on this feedback, we're pretty confident that the "Office Hours & Coffee Lounge" format does indeed work as intended for our members.

OK, so this new format seems to be popular with the Data Dojo members, but does it also work well for the organizers? We've found that the "Office Hours & Coffee Lounge" format is actually easier for us to organize than our other workshop formats, because we don't have to prepare anything in advance. This means that we can spend less time planning and more time engaging with our members, which is a win-win for everyone involved. We've also found that this format allows us to be more flexible and responsive to the needs of our members, and it has already helped us to better understand what they want from the Data Dojo and how we can continue to improve our future workshops, regardless of format.

# What About The Existing Formats?

The existing workshop formats that we've been using in the Data Dojo, such as presentations, hands-on labs, and interactive discussions, are still an important part of our repertoire, and we plan to continue using them in the future. We believe that each of these formats has its own unique strengths and benefits, and that they all play a valuable role in helping us to achieve our mission of fostering a successful Power BI Community of Practice. That being said, we also believe that it's important to keep things fresh and exciting for our members, and to provide them with a variety of learning experiences that cater to a diverse audience. The "Office Hours & Coffee Lounge" format is just one example of how we're working to achieve this goal, and though we will continue to experiment with new formats in the future, we will always strive to maintain a balance between structure and flexibility.

# Next Time: The Data Dojo Goes Global!

As I'm sure many of you already know, I've been speaking about the Data Dojo at various conferences, user groups, and livestreams for a couple years now. In my conversations with some of the folks I've met through these events, I've learned that many of them are interested in founding similar Power BI Communities of Practice within their own organizations all over the world.

So, in the next installment of this series, I'll share some of the insights I've gained from those conversations, and I'll talk about our plans to help other organizations establish their own Data Dojos, and our vision for a global network of Power BI Communities of Practice. This process is still in its very early stages, so I don't know exactly what it's going to look like yet, or when I will have more information to share with you, but I'm thrilled to be embarking on this new quest in the Data Dojo saga, and I can't wait to see where it takes us.

If you are interested in founding a Power BI Community of Practice within your organization, or if you're just curious to learn more about what we're doing with the Data Dojo, I'd love to hear from you!
