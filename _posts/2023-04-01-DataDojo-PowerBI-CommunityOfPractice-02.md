# Our First Workshop

We launched the Data Dojo with our first workshop on July 20th, 2022, and it was a huge success! We had eighteen members in attendance, and we covered the following topics (slide deck [here]()):
- Introductions around the room
- What we're doing here, and why it matters
- The importance of speed and accuracy in data analysis, and what we mean by "speed" and "accuracy"
- Data driven decision makers:
  - What they **do know**
  - What they often **don't know**
- The current paradigm and state of data analysis at DMU
- The new paradigm — our vision for the future
- Our plans for turning that vision into a reality
- Testimonials from four Data Dojo members who had already been using Power BI in their day-to-day jobs, experienced first-hand the benefits of data-driven decision making, and successfully collaborated on at least one Power BI project with one or more colleagues from other departments
- Our next steps
  - Added everyone who attended the workshop to our private Yammer group, and encouraged them to introduce themselves, ask questions, share ideas, and vote on dates and topics for future workshops
  - Provided [a list of Power BI learning resources]() for those who wanted to dive in right away

# Our Second Workshop

We held our second Data Dojo workshop about a month later, this time with twenty members in attendance! Here's an outline of what we covered (slide deck [here]()):
- **The Five Types of Data Analytics:**
  1. Descriptive — *"What happened, where, and when?"*
  2. Diagnostic — *"Why did it happen?"*
  3. Predictive — *"What will happen in the future?"*
  4. Prescriptive — *"What should we do about it?"*
  5. Cognitive — *"How can we do it better?"*
- **The Data Analytics Cycle**
  1. Requirements gathering
  2. Data ingestion and processing
  3. Data exploration
  4. Data analysis
  5. Deploy analytics solution
  6. Request and process feedback
  7. Optimize solution
  8. Repeat
- **Structured vs. Unstructured Data**
  - Definitions
  - Examples
- **Better Instruction Through Data** — A presentation by one of our members from outside the IT department, which included:
  - A live demo of some of the reports he had made using curated datasets provided by the IT department
  - Stories of how several of his reports had already made a significant impact on the way his department operates on a day-to-day basis
  - Examples of some challenges he has encountered working with data, and how he overcame them by utilizing our learning resources and collaborating with other members of the Data Dojo from both his own department and other departments
