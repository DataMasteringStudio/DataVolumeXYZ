I joined [Des Moines University](https://dmu.edu) as a Senior Business Intelligence Analyst in December of 2020, and one of the first things I noticed whenever I got to know a colleague from another department was that many of them were eager to begin analyzing the data generated by their individual business units, but didn't know where to start. Of course, there are tons of excellent books, videos, blogs, and self-paced e-learning resources about Power BI and data analytics in general, but I've found that the best way to **learn** is to **do**, and the best way to **do** is **together**.

The natural solution was to establish an inter-disciplinary Power BI [Community of Practice (CoP)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community_of_practice) at DMU, which is exactly what we are now in the process of doing. We call our CoP the **Data Dojo**, and I'm excited to share our journey with you. This is the first in a series of posts that will document our challenges, progress, setbacks, and victories. I hope you'll join us on this adventure!

# Founding the Data Dojo

From the very beginning, I knew that there were varying levels of Power BI experience among the faculty and staff at DMU. Some had never even heard of Power BI, while others had already been using it for several years. I also knew that I didn't have the time or energy to teach everyone everything they needed to know about Power BI on an individual basis. Additionally, I knew that I couldn't be the only one teaching if I wanted to have an organization-wide impact. And finally, I knew that a hierarchical structure would only hinder our ability to grow and adapt organically. So, with all of that in mind, I created our Data Dojo with these founding principles:

1. Anyone who is interested in learning how to make better use of their data can become a Data Dojo member.
2. Members are welcome to attend as many (or as few) of our workshops as they like.
3. Members are encouraged to share their knowledge and experience, though no one is required to do so.
4. We facilitate the sharing of knowledge primarily through two channels:
  * Interactive workshops (in-person, virtual, or hybrid).
  * A private [Yammer](https://www.yammer.com) group where members can ask questions, share ideas, and collaborate on projects.
5. There are no instructors or students in the Data Dojo; We are all here to learn from each other.
6. The only "stupid question" in the Data Dojo is the one that goes unasked.
7. Members vote on the topics they'd like to learn about, as well as the dates and times for the workshops where those topics will be covered.
8. Members are encouraged to network with each other, form their own ad-hoc groups, and collaborate on projects together. This is designed to break down the silos and walls that have hindered the business in the past, and replace them with pipelines and bridges.
