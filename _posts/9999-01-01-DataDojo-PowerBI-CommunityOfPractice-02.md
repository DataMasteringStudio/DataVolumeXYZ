# Our First Workshop

We launched the Data Dojo with our first workshop on July 20th, 2022, and it was a huge success! We had eighteen members in attendance, and we covered the following topics<!-- (slide deck [here]())-->:
- Introductions around the room
- What we're doing here, and why it matters
- The importance of speed and accuracy in data analysis, and what we mean by "speed" and "accuracy"
- Data driven decision makers:
  - What they **do know**
  - What they often **don't know**
- The current paradigm and state of data analysis at DMU
- The new paradigm — our vision for the future
- Our plans for turning that vision into a reality
- Testimonials from four Data Dojo members who had already been using Power BI in their day-to-day jobs, experienced first-hand the benefits of data-driven decision making, and successfully collaborated on at least one Power BI project with one or more colleagues from other departments
- Our next steps
  - Added everyone who attended the workshop to our private Yammer group, and encouraged them to introduce themselves, ask questions, share ideas, and vote on dates and topics for future workshops
  - Provided [a list of Power BI learning resources]() for those who wanted to dive in right away

# Our Second Workshop

We held our second Data Dojo workshop about a month later, this time with twenty members in attendance! Here's an outline of what we covered<!-- (slide deck [here]())-->:
- **The Five Types of Data Analytics:**
  1. Descriptive — *"What happened, where, and when?"*
  2. Diagnostic — *"Why did it happen?"*
  3. Predictive — *"What will happen in the future?"*
  4. Prescriptive — *"What should we do about it?"*
  5. Cognitive — *"How can we do it better?"*
- **The Data Analytics Cycle**
  1. Requirements gathering
  2. Data ingestion and processing
  3. Data exploration
  4. Data analysis
  5. Deploy analytics solution
  6. Request and process feedback
  7. Optimize solution
  8. Repeat
- **Structured vs. Unstructured Data**
  - Definitions
  - Examples
- **Better Instruction Through Data** — A presentation by one of our members from outside the IT department, which included:
  - A live demo of some of the reports he had made using curated datasets provided by the IT department
  - Stories of how several of his reports had already made a significant impact on the way his department operates on a day-to-day basis
  - Examples of some challenges he has encountered working with data, and how he overcame them by utilizing our learning resources and collaborating with other members of the Data Dojo from both his own department and other departments

# Our First Major Setback

After such a strong start, it really felt like nothing could stop us, and we were well on our way to achieving our vision of a data-driven DMU. But then, we hit a snag. A big one.

For several years, DMU has been in the process of [building a new campus](https://www.dmu.edu/new-campus/) in West Des Moines, and it's scheduled to open later this year (Fall of 2023). Of course, this is a huge undertaking, and it's been a major focus for the entire university. As you can probably imagine, every department at DMU has been extremely busy with a number of projects related to the new campus, and that has had a significant impact on the amount of time and energy they have been able to devote to the Data Dojo. 

I'd really like to say that the new campus project commitments were the only thing that slowed us down, but that wouldn't be entirely true. I also made a few mistakes along the way, and I'd like to share them with you so that you can avoid making the same mistakes.

## Mistake #1: Failing to Keep a Consistent Schedule

After our second workshop, we had a lot of momentum, and I was eager to keep it going, but I didn't have a clear plan for how to do that. I knew that I wanted to hold a workshop every month or so, but given the frenetic pace of projects at the new campus, it was hard to find dates that worked for most of our members. I really should have just found a date that worked for a dozen or so members, but instead I kept pushing it back indefinitely, hoping that I would eventually find a date that worked for everyone. The worst part of this was that I didn't communicate any of this to our members, so they had no idea what was going on. I'm sure that many of them thought that the Data Dojo had just fizzled out, and that was entirely my fault.

## Mistake #2: Failing to Keep the Conversation Going

My second mistake was not having a strategy for keeping the conversation going between workshops. I had created a private Yammer group for the Data Dojo, and everyone who had attended at least one workshop so far was a member of that group, but my efforts at encouraging members to engage in conversations there achieved only sporadic results at best. There were definitely some great conversations, but mostly between the same few members, and I also didn't do a very good job of seeding the discussion myself with new material. I should have been posting more questions, sharing more ideas, and encouraging more members to do the same. 

## Mistake #3: 

<!-- add conclusion and teaser for part 3 -->

# Conclusion

<!-- I think the summary here is that the overall pitfall here is searching for perfection without planning for functionality. You not only wanted a date that worked for every single person but you wanted the "perfect" content (waiting for whatever update to roll out). It's a bit idealistic to assume that tech anything happens on a convenient or timely schedule. Prioritizing conversation, regardless of content and attendence perfection, is clearly an important factor in developing the kind of data driven and data literate culture that DMU or any other organization would benefit from. -->
